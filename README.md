First attempt at creating software to interact with the Kalshi API and learn how to make trades.

I attempted to model tennis odds using prior data, but I've scrapped this approach to finding an edge as past data doesn't seem to be reliable in the ways I'm utilising it.

Currently, I'm attempting to model tennis games in different ways to explore the dynamics of tennis "odds" over time.
