I used Jeff Sackmann's Tennis Data in order to create a predictive probability model of tennis games based off past games, elo, court conditions, serve percentage, etc. I then integrated it with the Kalshi API in order to incorporate the ability to paper trade & live trade directly through a terminal window, with live P&L and portfolio statistics that update in real time.
